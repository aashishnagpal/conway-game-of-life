# Conway's Game of Life

This is my attempt at programming the Conway's Game of Life in different JavaScript frameworks. This will be a ever growing repository and my stepping stone every time I learn a new JavaScript framework.

## Look at the code

### AngularJS

- Two ways to check out the code.
    - Look at it here on GitHub. Fork it and modify to your choice.
    - Download the zipped folder, unpack it and follow below mentioned instructions.

- Extract the zipped folder as is. Make sure you have AngularJS directory at the top level within which the folders named 'app' and 'test' are there. 

- Navigate to /AngularJS/app/ folder and run index.html **_Make Sure to RUN this file using Firefox Browser ONLY_**.

- All the instructions to work through the app are mentioned on the page itself, once you have the app running in the browser.

- You can see the test runs from within the running application. Just see the instructions at the bottom of the page.
